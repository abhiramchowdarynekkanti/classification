üìä Classification Project with Evaluation & Dashboard Integration
This project involves building a classification model to predict [insert target variable here], exploring various machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics. The workflow includes training models, evaluating performance with and without hyperparameter tuning, and visualizing results on an interactive dashboard.

üîç Key Features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

Model evaluation using metrics such as:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

ROC-AUC

Confusion Matrix

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV

Comparison of model performance before and after tuning
